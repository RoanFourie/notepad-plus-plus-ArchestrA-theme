# Notepad++ ArchestrA Solarized syntax highlighting theme.  

## [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is an alterantive text editor with syntax highlighting.  
[This repository]() contain a syntax highlighting template for the ArchestrA scripting language.
This specific one is done according to the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) dark theme which was scientifically worked out:  

Quote from the Solarized color scheme website from Ethan:  

 ```"Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several [unique properties](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized#features). I designed this colorscheme with both precise [CIELAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions."``` - source http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized  

The ArchestrA theme will look something like this in Notepad++:
