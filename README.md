# [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is an alterantive text editor with syntax highlighting.  
[This repository]() contain a syntax highlighting template for the ArchestrA scripting language.
This specific one is done according to the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) dark theme which was scientifically worked out:  

  "Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions." - source http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized  

The ArchestrA theme will look something like this in Notepad++:
